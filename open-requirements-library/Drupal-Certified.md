## Why an open source RFP guide?

**We have created this set of templates to help organizations looking for vendors**—contractors or agencies—to develop and implement website and digital experience projects using open source content management systems (CMSs).

Shaping the future of digital experiences in an open web relies on all of us putting open source values into practice. Among those values, transparency and sharing what we improve with our communities are the motivations for publishing this RFP and procurement guide. 

In it, you will find a solid foundation for planning your technical project RFP and room to customize it to your needs. It also contains sensible and reasonable conditions for potential vendors to meet regarding open source expertise and experience. We cannot make any guarantees, but if a vendor meets the conditions, it is a good sign that they will be a good technical partner for your project. By contributing to their core open source technologies—like their CMS—they will have gained valuable expertise, and there’s a good chance they could be a good implementation partner for your project. 

**If you are preparing a Request for Proposals, this material will help you:**

* Find service providers qualified and experienced in open source content management systems (CMSs) and related systems and methodologies.

* Objectively sort between competing vendors.

* Ensure you’re not forgetting any significant factors or information…  at least based on our experience :-)

## How to prepare your RFP vendor instructions and terms of reference

* **Find and replace:** Information you need to fill in or customize for your organization and project is in square brackets and marked with two asterisks in the document. Search for \*\* and fill in the appropriate necessary information.

  * You are the “ORGANIZATION” requesting proposals from vendors to provide you with digital project and website-building services.

  * You need to fill in the project name, dates, timelines, and other specifics of your project.

* **RFP?** Depending on your location and the nature of your organization and project, Requests for Proposals (RFP) may be called different things, such as Request for Information (RFI), tender, or bid. Search for “RFP” in this document and “Request for Proposal” and replace as appropriate. 

* **“We”** in the instructions refers to the organization looking for help with a project—you, the reader\!

* **“You”** in the instructions refers to vendors who want to bid to be your vendor. 

* **Logo:** Replace the “your logo here” images with your logo.
