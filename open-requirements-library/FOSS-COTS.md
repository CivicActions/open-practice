# Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)

This document summarizes key points from an article advocating for the recognition and prioritization of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solutions within government agencies.

**Original Document:** [Free and Open Source Software is COTS: Affordable, Efficient, and Proven](https://www.govloop.com/community/blog/free-and-open-source-software-is-cots-affordable-efficient-and-proven/)

**Key Points:**

* FOSS is COTS: The article argues that FOSS should be classified and treated as COTS software by government agencies, aligning with recent Executive Orders that emphasize COTS solutions for their speed, cost savings, and innovation potential.  
* Government Definitions Support FOSS as Commercial: U.S. government definitions, including guidance from the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101, support the classification of FOSS as a commercial product.  
* Advantages of Open Source COTS:  
  * No Licensing Fees: Eliminates recurring licensing costs associated with proprietary software.  
  * Prevents Vendor Lock-in: Offers agencies greater flexibility and avoids dependence on a single vendor.  
  * Complete Code Visibility: Provides full transparency into the software's codebase, enhancing trust and auditability.  
  * Enhanced Flexibility: Allows for customization and adaptation to specific agency needs without proprietary restrictions.  
* Addressing Concerns (Support and Security): Commercial open source software (COSS) vendors provide enterprise-grade support comparable to traditional COTS providers, often with greater transparency and control over the software's evolution and security.  
* Call to Action: The article urges government agencies to update their procurement practices to acknowledge open source COTS as a proven, affordable, and efficient standard, rather than defaulting to more expensive custom development or restrictive proprietary solutions.
