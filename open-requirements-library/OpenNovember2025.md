# Open November 2025: A CivicActions Initiative for the Digital Services Community

Open November is a month-long initiative led by CivicActions and open to the broader digital services community. The goal is to strengthen our collective commitment to open source, transparency, and shared knowledge through meaningful contributions to the Digital Commons.

Throughout November, individuals and teams across digital government, civic tech, and open source communities are invited to contribute tools, documentation, templates, and practices that advance open collaboration. Each contribution helps grow the shared library of resources that supports better, more equitable digital services.

Join us in growing the Digital Commons and making openness the standard for how we work and share knowledge.
