**What is the purpose of this manual?** 

Orals presentations to public sector agencies can be a stressful—yet critical—step in the solicitation process of procurement. The agency gets to see the chemistry of the bidding team and their comprehension of the work. But also, the bidder needs to be memorable as the agency evaluates not only who was compliant but who “felt right” and had a strong command of the work.

It’s a tricky task to prep a team for this, especially because very few of the presenters are talking about their work in a mini-theater like this on a daily, or even quarterly, basis. 

Orals often require cross-team collaboration in a few weeks or even days to pull off a cohesive, clear and compliant presentation. So, over years of experience and trials and tribulations, we have compiled our best practices—which continue to evolve through trends of remote versus in-person, slide visuals, AI automation and more. 

Our comprehensive manual is designed to equip technical Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) with the necessary skills, strategies, and tools to excel in high-stakes client presentations and discussions.

Our objective is to transform technical expertise into clear, compelling, and client-centric communications that consistently reinforce the value and quality of the bidder's solutions.
This training manual is specifically tailored to prepare technical SMEs for success in a range of critical client interactions, including, but not limited to:

**Capability Briefings:** Delivering concise and impactful overviews of bidder’s technical proficiencies, past performance, and relevant solution stacks to prospective clients.

**Oral Presentations (Virtual or In-Person):** Mastering the art of the formal proposal presentation, ensuring the technical solution is articulated clearly, aligned with the client's needs, and presented with maximum persuasive impact, whether in a physical conference room or via a digital platform.

**Technical Demonstrations:** Conducting live or simulated walkthroughs of a proposed system, feature, or platform, focusing on user experience, technical feasibility, and direct compliance with client requirements.

**Capture-Phase Technical Discussions:** Engaging in pre-RFP (Request for Proposal) or early-phase client meetings to understand deeply-rooted technical challenges, shape the client's requirements, and position the bidder as the trusted expert partner.

**Follow-up Q&A with Client Evaluators:** Developing advanced techniques for responding to challenging, complex, or unexpected questions under pressure, maintaining composure, and providing answers that are accurate, strategic, and consistent with the overall proposal strategy.
