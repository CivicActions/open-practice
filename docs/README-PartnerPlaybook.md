# **Partner Playbook**

## **What is it?** 

The Partner Playbook is an editable tool to articulate and inspire positive collaborative experiences among organizations. 

Guided by the values of balance, openness and care, companies can enter into teaming to create mutually beneficial relationships extending beyond revenue share. Teaming in this regard seeks an uplifting culture, collaborative delivery, and positive impact for humanity and the planet. The Playbook is intended to be adapted and agreed upon by teaming partners for inclusion into a teaming agreement. It is not a replacement for a teaming agreement, but rather an expression of understanding, a commitment to empathy and transparency, and a touchstone for the foundation and practice of the working relationship.

## **How can it be used?**

The Playbook was originally created to support companies teaming in pursuit of contract opportunities with the United States government. While this is a common use case, the model of the Playbook can be adapted to fit many other scenarios. 

## **Why are we sharing this?** 

Drawing on corporate experience of 20+ years in digital services and open source software solutions, and augmented by the collective experience of our team members, CivicActions aims to empower public services with best practices in product, process, program, operations and technology.

We operate on the pillars of digital public goods, which include open knowledge, open data, open code and open standards. With this, we also maintain a belief in the power of community—inviting contribution from a wider community of fellow technologists, practitioners and emerging talent. And, above all, we are guided by our values of balance, openness and care.

We also provide a version as a [Word Document](https://github.com/CivicActions/open-practice/blob/main/docs/_Template%20-%20Partner%20Playbook.docx).

CivicActions, as the maintaining party, commits to routinely review comments, follow up on questions and add edits deemed to best align with the objective of the Playbook.
