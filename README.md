# Open Practices Resource

Open standards, open source, open data, open science, open government are ultimately about sharing. Open practices are any combination of these, and the policies, procedures and processes that make it a good practice. Open practices are also ultimately about good governance. Yes, your team should know/understand what their practices are, but they should be comparible with others. How do the approaches that your team comes up with compare with others.
